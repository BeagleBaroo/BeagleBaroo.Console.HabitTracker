# Habit Tracker

## Given Requirements:

* This is an application where you’ll log occurrences of a habit.
* This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
* Users need to be able to input the date of the occurrence of the habit
* The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
* When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
* It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
* The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
* You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
* You can only interact with the database using ADO.NET. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework or Dapper.
* Follow the DRY Principle, and avoid code repetition.
* Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works.
